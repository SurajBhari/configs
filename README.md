# configs

# These spawns are made with keeping atleast 60 seconds round time in mind.

What this configs for ? 
A. this is for github.com/splewis/csgo-executes  

So a unnamed company forcefully took configs from me , so i have decided to make them public
all maps are tested on a mp_maxplayers 10 server for several months 
i cant find any kind of bug , as they are mostly fixed at the present time 

Q. what about the cache config , as it will soon get a makeover ? 
A. I will try to update its config as soon as its released :) 

Q. which *unnamed company* you are talking about ?
A. we are no stranger to it , you know the rules and so do i xD

Q. Where I can contact you in future ? 
A. i am most active on discord - AG #7863

Sorry if i am doing anything wrong here, probably cuz i am new to this, and also too young (17 Y/o ;-;)

And do me a favour share this as much as you can :)

**NOTE**

**New de_cache version added as de_cache(new,tested).cfg **
